/**
 * Stops a leftover development server for this project.
 *
 * Why this exists: Next.js refuses to start a second `next dev` for the same
 * directory ("Another next dev server is already running") and exits with code
 * 1. That happens whenever a previous server survived — a terminal that was
 * closed instead of interrupted, a crashed run, or a server started in the
 * background. The framework prints the PID, but you have to go and hunt it down.
 *
 * This script finds every process whose working directory is this repo and
 * whose command line mentions Next, then asks it to stop.
